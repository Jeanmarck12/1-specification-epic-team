## Stakeholders

### Names

**Sabine Membreno (2nd-year Graduate College Student in NYC)**

My interview was focused on understanding their experiences finding housing and roommates during their graduate studies, as well as current challenges they face with housing arrangements. This allows us as a team to understand the specific needs of a graduate student, such as different schedules, budgets, and living preferences compared to undergraduates. As a result, their six year navigation in the NYC housing market in the midst of academic and work commitments makes them an ideal candidate. It helps us understand the complexity of finding compatible roommates and affordable housing based on our users.

**Dylan Membreno (2nd-year Undergraduate College Student in NYC)**

Throughout the interview process, I involved the discussion around their entry into the NYC housing market recently as a freshman last year. This also includes speaking on their roommate situation and future housing plans. As a sophomore undergraduate student, the team is able to view someone is able to explain what they are looking for with fellow college students in a property with a fresh eye. But in addition, they are able to provide feedback on their current situation roughly a year later into it.

## Goals Or Needs

### To find compatible roommates with similar lifestyles and budgets

Students need to connect with potential roommates who share their living preferences, social activity, study habits, sleeping patterns, noise regulation, cleanliness standards, and financial capabilities.

- **Sabine:** She would like options to find roommates who take their academic/work commitments seriously, avoiding late nights.
- **Dylan:** He recommends roommates who are willing to be clear early on about scheduling and splitting fair groceries fairly.

### To discover available rental properties within student budgets

College students require access to affordable housing, with a location that is either near campus or with good transportation links.

- **Dylan:** I want the ability as a user to avoid getting lost in apartments that clearly do not find my needs in location and price range.

### To coordinate group housing searches and applications

Once students find potential roommate matches on the app, they need tools to organize group viewings, share property listings, and coordinate application processes.

- **Sabine:** It can be a nightmare getting to arrange viewing times with three or more people. I would use an app that gave the ability to do this effectively and efficiently.

### To verify roommate reliability and safety

Students need to ensure potential roommates are trustworthy and legitimate. The app should include basic verification features, reviews, or references from previous living situations to build confidence from users.

- **Dylan:** It would be great to know their own experiences living with other roommates/apartments.

### To manage sharing housing logistics and expenses

Once housing is secured, students need ongoing roommate/landlord communication. In addition they need information on splitting rent, utilities, and other shared expenses.

- **Sabine:** She likes the idea of digitally tracking who owes rent, internet, and groceries.
